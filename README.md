# Parking Lots Suck!

This is a lightweight app that lets you see parking lots in your area and see our score for them. Parking Lots can be improved and we are looking to do so!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the site run.

Please note you will have to provide an API_KEY for this by creating a `.env.local` file or setting environment variables on a site like Vercel or Heroku. Please feel free to check out [this site](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search) for more info on the YELP api.
